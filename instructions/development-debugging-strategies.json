Problem definition and hypothesis generation\n2. Investigation strategy and reproduction steps\n3. Root cause analysis\n4. Solution implementation and validation\n\nBug details:\nIssue: [describe the problem]\nSteps to reproduce: [how to recreate]\nExpected vs actual behavior: [what should vs does happen]\nError messages: [any logs or errors]\nEnvironment: [OS, versions, recent changes]\nCode: [relevant code sections]\n\nProvide:\n**Root Cause Hypotheses**: [ranked by likelihood]\n**Investigation Plan**: [systematic debugging steps]\n**Diagnostic Commands**: [specific debugging tools/commands]\n**Solution**: [minimal fix that addresses root cause]\n**Prevention**: [how to avoid similar issues]\n**Testing**: [how to verify the fix works]\n\nIf unclear, ask specific clarifying questions about the environment or reproduction steps.",
