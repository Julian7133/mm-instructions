Problem definition and hypothesis generation\n2. Investigation strategy and reproduction steps\n3. Root cause analysis\n4. Solution implementation and validation\n\nIssue: [describe the problem you're experiencing]\nError messages: [any logs, stack traces, or error output]\n\nIf you need more details about reproduction steps, environment, code, or recent changes, ask clarifying questions.\n\nProvide:\n**Root Cause Hypotheses**: [ranked by likelihood]\n**Investigation Plan**: [systematic debugging steps]\n**Diagnostic Commands**: [specific debugging tools/commands]\n**Solution**: [minimal fix that addresses root cause]\n**Prevention**: [how to avoid similar issues]\n**Testing**: [how to verify the fix works]",
