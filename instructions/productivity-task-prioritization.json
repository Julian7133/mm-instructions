Urgent + Important (do first)\n2. Important, not urgent (schedule)\n3. Urgent, not important (delegate)\n4. Neither urgent nor important (eliminate)\n\nFor each task, also consider impact level, effort required, dependencies, and deadlines.\n\nTasks: [list all your tasks here]\n\nIf you need more context about available time, goals, or deadlines, ask clarifying questions.\n\nFormat as:\n**Do First**: [urgent + important tasks]\n**Schedule**: [important but not urgent]\n**Delegate/Quick wins**: [urgent but not important]\n**Eliminate**: [low value tasks]\n\n**Recommended daily schedule**: [time-blocked schedule]",
